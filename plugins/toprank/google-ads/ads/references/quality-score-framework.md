# Quality Score Diagnostics & Optimization Playbook

Systematic framework for diagnosing, prioritizing, and improving Quality Score across Google Ads accounts. Every recommendation includes concrete thresholds and specific actions.

## Quality Score Component Breakdown

Quality Score (QS) is a 1-10 keyword-level metric composed of three sub-components, each rated independently:

| Component | Weight (approx.) | Rating Scale | What Google Evaluates |
|-----------|------------------|--------------|----------------------|
| **Expected CTR** | ~35-40% | Below Average / Average / Above Average | Historical CTR of the keyword normalized for ad position, extensions, and format |
| **Ad Relevance** | ~20-25% | Below Average / Average / Above Average | How closely your ad copy matches the intent and language of the keyword |
| **Landing Page Experience** | ~35-40% | Below Average / Average / Above Average | Page load speed, mobile-friendliness, content relevance, navigation clarity, trust signals |

**Disclaimer**: Google has never published official QS component weights. The ranges above are estimates derived from third-party regression studies and may shift over time. Use them directionally, not as exact figures.

**Key insight**: Landing Page Experience and Expected CTR together account for the majority (~70-80%) of QS. Ad Relevance is the smallest factor but often the easiest to fix.

---

## QS Impact on Cost-Per-Click

Quality Score directly modifies your actual CPC through the Ad Rank formula. Below are the approximate CPC modifiers relative to QS 5 (the neutral baseline).

> **Caveat**: These CPC impact figures are approximate estimates from third-party studies (notably WordStream and Optmyzr), not Google-published data. Actual CPC modifiers vary by auction, vertical, and account history.

| Quality Score | CPC Modifier vs. QS 5 Baseline | Effective CPC at $2.00 Benchmark | Impact on Budget |
|--------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------|
| 10 | -50% discount | $1.00 | Budget stretches 2x |
| 9 | -44% discount | $1.12 | Significant savings |
| 8 | -37% discount | $1.26 | Strong savings |
| 7 | -28% discount | $1.44 | Moderate savings |
| 6 | -17% discount | $1.66 | Slight savings |
| **5** | **Baseline (0%)** | **$2.00** | **No modifier** |
| 4 | +25% premium | $2.50 | Noticeable waste |
| 3 | +67% premium | $3.34 | Severe waste |
| 2 | +150% premium | $5.00 | Critical — pause or fix |
| 1 | +400% premium | $10.00 | Bleeding budget — immediate action |

**Rule of thumb**: Every 1-point QS increase above 5 saves ~16% on CPC. Every 1-point decrease below 5 costs ~50% more on CPC.

> **Smart Bidding context**: Throughout this playbook, where the advice says "increase bids," accounts using Smart Bidding (tCPA, tROAS, Maximize Conversions, Maximize Conversion Value) should adjust their target CPA or target ROAS instead. Smart Bidding sets bids automatically per auction — manual bid changes are overridden.

## Diagnostic Decision Tree

```
START: Keyword Quality Score
|
+-- QS >= 7
|   Action: Monitor. Maintain current performance. Look for QS 10 opportunities.
|
+-- QS 5-6
|   Action: Identify the Below Average component and fix it.
|   |
|   +-- Expected CTR = Below Average
|   |   Go to: Expected CTR Improvement Playbook (below)
|   |
|   +-- Ad Relevance = Below Average
|   |   Go to: Ad Relevance Improvement Playbook (below)
|   |
|   +-- Landing Page Experience = Below Average
|   |   Go to: Landing Page Improvement Playbook (below)
|   |
|   +-- All components = Average
|       Action: Test new ad copy with stronger CTAs and more specific headlines.
|       Target: Move one component from Average to Above Average.
|
+-- QS 3-4
|   Action: Urgent fix. Likely 2+ components Below Average.
|   Priority: Fix Landing Page Experience first (highest weight),
|   then Expected CTR, then Ad Relevance.
|
+-- QS 1-2
    Action: Critical. Consider pausing the keyword.
    Check: Is this keyword even relevant to your business?
    If yes: Rebuild — new ad group, new ad copy, new landing page.
    If no: Pause immediately. You are paying 2-5x market rate.
```

## Expected CTR Improvement Playbook

Expected CTR is position-adjusted, meaning Google accounts for your average position. A "Below Average" rating means your ads get fewer clicks than competitors in similar positions.

### CTR Benchmarks by Impression Location (Search Network)

Average Position was deprecated by Google in September 2019. Use Impression Location segments instead:

| Impression Location | Expected CTR Floor (Below Average threshold) | Good CTR | Excellent CTR |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------|----------|---------------|
| **Absolute Top** (first position above organic) | < 5.0% | 6.0-9.0% | > 9.0% |
| **Top** (above organic results, positions 2-4) | < 2.5% | 3.5-6.0% | > 6.0% |
| **Other** (bottom of page or secondary placements) | < 1.0% | 1.5-3.0% | > 3.0% |

> Use the "Top vs. Other" and "Abs. Top vs. Top" impression share metrics to understand where your ads appear. These replaced average position as the standard diagnostic.

### Fix Actions (Priority Order)

| # | Action | Expected Impact | Effort |
|---|--------|----------------|--------|
| 1 | Add the keyword (or close variant) to Headline 1 or 2 | +15-30% CTR | Low |
| 2 | Add sitelink extensions (minimum 4) | +10-20% CTR | Low |
| 3 | Add callout extensions with specific benefits | +5-10% CTR | Low |
| 4 | Add structured snippet extensions | +3-8% CTR | Low |
| 5 | Include a number in the headline (price, percentage, count) | +10-20% CTR | Low |
| 6 | Add urgency or scarcity language ("Limited", "Today Only") | +5-15% CTR | Low |
| 7 | Test a question-format headline matching the search query | +5-12% CTR | Medium |
| 8 | Review search terms — if irrelevant terms are diluting CTR, add negatives | +10-40% CTR | Medium |
| 9 | Break the ad group into tighter themes (fewer keywords, more specific ads) | +15-25% CTR | High |

### Historical CTR Analysis Checklist

- [ ] Pull 90-day CTR trend — is it declining, stable, or improving?
- [ ] Compare CTR across match types — broad match often drags down CTR via irrelevant queries
- [ ] Check device-level CTR — mobile CTR is typically 15-25% lower than desktop
- [ ] Review auction insights — new competitors entering can suppress CTR
- [ ] Check if ad extensions are showing — extension eligible rate < 50% means lost CTR opportunity

## Ad Relevance Improvement Playbook

Ad Relevance measures how well your ad copy matches the keyword's intent and language.

### Keyword-to-Headline Alignment Rules

| Scenario | Problem | Fix |
|----------|---------|-----|
| Keyword not in any headline | Google sees weak topical match | Add keyword or close synonym to Headline 1 or 2 |
| Keyword in headline but different intent | Ad promises something the keyword doesn't seek | Rewrite headline to match the search intent (informational, commercial, transactional) |
| Ad group has 30+ keywords | Impossible for 1 ad to be relevant to all keywords | Split into tighter ad groups: 5-10 keywords for broad match accounts (broad needs fewer keywords per group since each keyword matches widely), 10-20 for exact/phrase match accounts |
| Generic ad copy across all ad groups | Same ads everywhere = low relevance for specific terms | Write unique RSAs per ad group with keyword-specific headlines |
| Using only broad match keywords | Google matches queries far from original keyword | Review search terms; add phrase/exact match for high-value terms |

### Dynamic Keyword Insertion (DKI) Guidelines

| Use DKI When | Avoid DKI When |
|-------------|---------------|
| Ad group has 5-15 closely related keywords | Keywords are long (> 25 chars) — will truncate |
| Keywords are grammatically clean in headline context | Keywords contain competitor brand names |
| You want to quickly test relevance improvement | Keywords have mixed intent within the ad group |
| Landing page is genuinely relevant to all keyword variants | Industry requires careful language (medical, legal, financial) |

**DKI syntax**: `{KeyWord:Default Headline Text}` — capitalizes each word. Use `{keyword:default}` for sentence case.

### Close Variant Handling

Google matches exact and phrase match keywords to close variants including:
- Misspellings, singular/plural, stemming
- Abbreviations, acronyms
- Implied words, paraphrases, same-intent queries

**Impact on Ad Relevance**: If Google matches your keyword "running shoes" to the query "jogging sneakers," your ad copy must also cover that intent. Write headlines and descriptions that address the broader intent, not just the literal keyword.

| Server-side render above-fold content | -0.5 to -2.0 seconds | High |
| Upgrade hosting (shared → dedicated/cloud) | -0.5 to -3.0 seconds | High |

### Landing Page Relevance Scoring

Score your landing page 1-5 on each factor. Total < 15 = immediate rebuild needed.

| Factor | Score 1 (Poor) | Score 3 (Acceptable) | Score 5 (Excellent) |
|--------|---------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **Headline Match** | No relation to ad/keyword | Contains keyword in subhead | Exact keyword/intent in H1 |
| **Content Depth** | Thin page (< 200 words) | Adequate content (300-500 words) | Comprehensive (500+ words, structured) |
| **CTA Clarity** | No clear next step | CTA exists but buried | Above-fold CTA with clear value prop |
| **Trust Elements** | No trust signals | Basic (HTTPS only) | Reviews + certifications + guarantees |
| **Mobile UX** | Broken on mobile | Functional but clunky | Fast, thumb-friendly, optimized forms |
